## Desrciption

This repository contains related material, project files, logs and resources for the Data Sicence / Machine Learning Study Group.

## The AWS ML Stack

In the course material from the Machine Learning Career Pathway lesson at the AWS Educate, there was a short quiz testing the intuition on cloud service selection matching the requirements and needs of a hypothetical client. I made a small summary for you in the [AWS_ML_stack.md](https://github.com/bkocis/bertelsmann-dsml-group/blob/master/AWS_ML_stack.md).
